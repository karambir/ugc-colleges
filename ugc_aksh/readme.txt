I sort of had difficulty understanding your code coz m still a rookie at this.
So i wrote my own re and entire code.
My database name - sample
My table name - ex (create one before running script or change d table name in code to whatever u like)
My user name,pass - dere in the script

There are two files in this folder:
an html doc of ugc website hving list of colleges with names starting with 'A'.
I downloaded it to test.
Another is a txt file by the name text.txt..in which my script writes the colleges' names


p.s hope it helps
